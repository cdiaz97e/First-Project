# Sector Analysis Project

This project aims to complete simple sector analysis using historical price and volume data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance package and pandas datareaders.

I am a novice programmer and created this project as a means of praticing Python and as a introduction to coding in general. 

Successfully cloned this repository and pushed my first couple of files onto Github using a new branch, still getting used to it all.
